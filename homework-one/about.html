        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello there, my name is Mychal Wood! I am currently a Senior at IUPUI
          pursuing the Full Stack program, where I'll be getting two Bachelor's
          degrees when I graduate: Informatics and Media Arts and Science with a
          specialization in Web Design and Development. I grew up and have lived
          in Beech Grove my entire life, so I am very familiar with the
          surrounding area. Scroll down to see some of my likes and interests!

        <h1>My Likes & Interests</h1>
        <p>
          In my free time, I love to hang out with friends and family, watch TV,
          play videogames, build Legos, go camping, and much more! Some of my
          favorite video games are The Legend of Zelda, Mario Kart, Super Smash
          Bros Ultimate, Terraria, Fortnite, Minecraft, and the list goes on and
          on!

        <h1>My Skills With Technology</h1>
        <p>
          Also in my free time, I like to mess with various electronic things.
          From my 3D printer, to even my Raspberry Pi, there is a wide variety
          of things I like to mess with. I even plan on building a PC in the
          coming months to put the skills I've learned to the test, and to build
          one to game on! Also in high school, I was part of a Vex Robotics
          team, where I helped keep track of the engineering notebook and
          anything else that was needed at the time.
